## Recommendations by Use Case

### 🔒 Want to PROTECT your code?
**Use:** `NetworkTester_Compiled.pyz`
```bash
.\build_compiled.ps1
```
- Source code is compiled to bytecode
- Much harder to reverse engineer
- Users can't see your code in text editor

### 📦 Want SMALLEST size & simplicity?
**Use:** `NetworkTester.pyz`
```bash
.\build_portable.ps1
```
- Slightly larger file
- Source code is visible if extracted
- Good for open-source or trusted users

### 💻 Want NO Python requirement for users?
**Use:** `NetworkTester.exe` (PyInstaller)
```bash
.\build.ps1
```
- Large file (~10 MB)
- Users don't need Python installed
- Only works on Windows

### 🚀 For development/testing?
**Use:** Direct Python
```bash
python main.py
```
- Easiest for testing changes
- Not for distribution

## Security Levels

### Source Code Visibility:

1. **Direct Python (.py files)** - 🔴 Fully visible
   - Anyone can open and read your code
   
2. **Portable .pyz** - 🟠 Easily extracted
   - Can unzip and see source code
   - Command: `unzip NetworkTester.pyz`
   
3. **Compiled .pyz** - 🟡 Bytecode only
   - Source code replaced with .pyc files
   - Can be decompiled but much harder
   - Code is obfuscated, no comments/docstrings
   
4. **PyInstaller .exe** - 🟢 Most protected
   - Very difficult to extract
   - Requires specialized tools
   - Best protection, but largest size

## What Happens When User Opens Your File?

### NetworkTester.pyz (Portable)
```
If user extracts it, they see:
├── services/
│   ├── ping_service.py       ← Your actual code!
│   ├── logger_service.py     ← Your actual code!
│   └── email_service.py      ← Your actual code!
├── src/
│   └── network_monitor.py    ← Your actual code!
└── main.py                    ← Your actual code!
```

### NetworkTester_Compiled.pyz (Protected)
```
If user extracts it, they see:
├── services/
│   ├── ping_service.pyc      ← Compiled bytecode (unreadable)
│   ├── logger_service.pyc    ← Compiled bytecode (unreadable)
│   └── email_service.pyc     ← Compiled bytecode (unreadable)
├── src/
│   └── network_monitor.pyc   ← Compiled bytecode (unreadable)
└── main.pyc                   ← Compiled bytecode (unreadable)
```

When opened in a text editor, .pyc files look like:
```
�����f��@�@s�ddlZddlZddlZddlmZGdd�d�ZdS)�
    ���...gibberish...���
```

## TLDR - Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Compiled .pyz if:**
- ✅ You want to protect your source code
- ✅ You're okay with users having Python installed
- ✅ You want small file size
- ✅ You want cross-platform compatibility

**Choose EXE if:**
- ✅ Users might not have Python
- ✅ Maximum code protection needed
- ❌ Don't mind 10 MB file size
- ❌ Windows only is okay

**Choose Portable .pyz if:**
- ✅ You don't care about code visibility
- ✅ Open source project
- ✅ Smallest file size
- ✅ Cross-platform
